### 1. Monte-Carlo-Spades
You are to draw a card 13 times from a standard 52-card deck, replacing it after each draw. How many times do you draw a spade?

What I want the code to do:
- Receive an argument : number of iterations (of 13 draws)
- Generate a distribution table containing cumulative frequency of spades, running average and optionally display that table
- Plot a scatterplot of spade draws against trial
- Plot the cummulative average number of draws for the entire simulation
